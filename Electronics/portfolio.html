                A fuse is a safety device used in electrical circuits to protect against overcurrent conditions. It consists of a thin strip or wire made of a material that melts when exposed to excessive current. When the current passing through the fuse exceeds its rated value, the strip or wire melts, breaking the circuit and interrupting the flow of electricity. This helps prevent damage to the circuit and connected devices, as well as the risk of fire or electrical hazards. Fuses are designed to be replaceable, providing a simple and effective means of protecting electrical systems.</p>

        Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that periodically reverses direction, changing polarity over time. It flows in a sinusoidal waveform, with the direction of current alternating between positive and negative cycles. AC is generated by rotating machinery such as generators or alternators and is commonly used in electrical power distribution systems and household appliances. Unlike direct current (DC), which flows continuously in one direction, AC allows for efficient transmission of electricity over long distances and is easily transformed to different voltage levels using transformers. AC power is characterized by its frequency, measured in hertz (Hz), which determines the number of complete cycles per second.</p>
